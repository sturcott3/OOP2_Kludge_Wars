# OOP2_Kludge_Wars
major project, partnered

//Special instructions for 'playing' the game:
  This Game is a Choose your own Adventure style story-based game. Read some stuff, make a choice, manage  your resources, Rinse, repeat. The amount of story content is somewhat short, though this is slightly compensated for with the procedurally generated content. The systems are in place to expand the story rapidly, if we choose to continue work at a later date. More on project scope later. 

What to 'do':
  - The Gui is fairly robust, and will not allow the user to do ceratin things in certain situations
  - The 'Board ship' button lets the user change between being on the ship or outside of it, as appropriate
  - The 2-5 buttons displayed in the flow panel below the story text allow the user to make dialog 'choices'. A choice must be made each        turn before proceeding to the next.
  - The 'Warp' button proceeds to the next turn. One of the status labels will show the entered shipName when this is possible
  - The items displayed in the inventory will have their effects applied and dissapear on click, even if there is no need (the user can       expend a health pack while at full health). Manage resources accordingly.
  - The score in the game is 'Distance Travelled', aka number of turns survived. The game has not been balanced very much, ie. the user       will usually die from ship damage ~ 15 turns in or so, even if they are careful.  

//Sam's 'I learned' section:

  In doing this project I learned a number of valuable lessons about working with more sizeable codebases. 
  
  First, we decided to use Git to manage our files, and this created a fairly steep learning curve, as it was my first time working with any kind of source control. It is extremely useful, and I look forward to continuing to learn about it going forward.
  
  Second, I learned a valuable lesson about project scope, namely that starting as big as we did was not a great decision. We completed a very large portion of what we set out to do, but the lofty goals we bagan with were a little unrealistic. 
  
  Finally, this was also my first experience sharing code with another programmer, which is another kettle of fish entirely. Luckily, I was fortunate enough to work with another strong student. This project was excellent practice at removing my ego from the process. This is something I do not usually have trouble with, but that I now see that it will be more difficult to do this in the context of programming.
  
 //Matt's 'I learned' section:
 
  It was an interesting experience working on this project, it taught me how to work with Git as well as working on a codebase with others. Secondly it taught me to design my code to be more object-oriented rather than single-use classes. Project scope was also an issue initially on this project, and going forward I would limit those very ambitious goals and set realistic ones based on the time-scale of the project.
