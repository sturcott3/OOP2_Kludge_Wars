//Special instructions for running the project:


//Sam's 'I learned' section:

  In doing this project I learned a number of valuable lessons about working with more sizeable codebases. 
  
  First, we decided to use Git to manage our files, and this created a fairly steep learning curve, as it was my first time working with 
  any kind of source control. It is extremely useful, and I look forward to continuing to learn about it going forward.
  
  Second, I learned a valuable lesson about project scope, namely that starting as big as we did was not a great decision. We completed a 
  very large portion of what we set out to do, but the lofty goals we bagan with were a little unrealistic.
