//Special instructions for running the project:


//Sam's 'I learned' section:

  In doing this project I learned a number of valuable lessons about working with more sizeable codebases. 
  
  First, we decided to use Git to manage our files, and this created a fairly steep learning curve, as it was my first time working with 
  any kind of source control. It is extremely useful, and I look forward to continuing to learn about it going forward.
  
  Second, I learned a valuable lesson about project scope, namely that starting as big as we did was not a great decision. We completed a 
  very large portion of what we set out to do, but the lofty goals we bagan with were a little unrealistic.
  
  
 //Matt's 'I learned' section:
  It was an interesting experience working on this project, it taught me how to work with Git as well as working on a codebase with others.   Secondly it taught me to design my code to be more object-oriented rather than single-use classes. Project scope was also an issue         initially on this project, and going forward I would limit those very ambitious goals and set realistic ones based on the time-scale of     the project.
